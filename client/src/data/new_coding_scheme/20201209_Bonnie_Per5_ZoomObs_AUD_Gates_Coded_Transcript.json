I think some students still had issues trying to figure out link to join. On there, good. All right. So as you're joining in let me go ahead and get you started on the PGQ.

Okay, good. I liked how this team mentioned that we let it go at the top of the ramp that we didn't push it down. Good. Because that would change the expiration.

So all you do is like you go on there, right. Do this and this put a bulleted format right now. That'd be awesome. Um, here comes Student_6. Uh, let's see, energy being mentioned here. Okay.
