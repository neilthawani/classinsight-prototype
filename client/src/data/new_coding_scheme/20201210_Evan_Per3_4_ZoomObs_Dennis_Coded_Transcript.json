Now if I'm summarizing, I wanna explain why plastic is bad. Plastic is bad because, um, we can't break it down and the plastic, uh, pollutes the ground and it makes so you can't grow plants. I don't know if that's true, but I just made that up. So that would be, though, outlining. It would be, you would be describing further. Okay?
